# Introduction

The [Atelier](https://github.com/johnstonskj/rust-atelier) project is a suite of Rust crates that provides the ability to read, write ands process AWS [Smithy](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy) models. Smithy itself is an abstract model, a custom IDL language, a mapping to/from JSON, and a build process. These crates replicate _some_, but not all, features of Smithy.

The following introduction sections will cover the [Smithy](smithy.md) models as well as the [Atelier](crates.md) crates in more detail.
